This chapter explains **how the research is conducted**, with emphasis on the simulator as a method.

- **Overall methodology**
    
    - Combination of real-world measurements and simulation-based evaluation.
        
- **Simulator-driven approach**
    
    - Why simulation is necessary to explore large-scale, dense deployments.
        
    - How the simulator abstracts PHY, MAC, mobility, and churn.
        
- **Channel and reception modeling**
    
    - Use of empirical sea-trial measurements to derive a probabilistic reception model.
        
    - Justification of distance-based reception probabilities.
        
- **Performance metrics**
    
    - Definition and motivation of Broadcast Packet Delivery Ratio (B-PDR).
        
    - Collision rate and energy footprint as secondary metrics.
        
- **Comparative evaluation**
    
    - Static Beaconing Protocol (SBP) as baseline.
        
    - Adaptive Density-Aware Beaconing (ADAB) as the adaptive strategy.
        
- **Experimental design**
    
    - Population scaling, stochastic churn, repeated runs, statistical robustness.
        

This chapter establishes **scientific rigor** and shows that the simulator is not ad hoc, but methodologically grounded.

% Utlizing the comments above try to write the chapter. And also explain the tecnical terms included. Maybe with online references usign LaTeX formatting and commands. you can use also the paper.pdf

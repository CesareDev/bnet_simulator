\begin{comment}
This chapter closes the thesis and reflects on its contributions.

- **Summary of contributions**
    
    - Design and implementation of a custom simulator for infrastructure-free Wi-Fi safety networks.
        
    - Demonstration of its usefulness through the ProSafe case study.
        
    - Validation of density-aware MAC adaptation (ADAB).
        
- **Scientific impact**
    
    - Insights into broadcast scalability in ad-hoc Wi-Fi systems.
        
    - Evidence that MAC-layer adaptation alone can yield large gains.
        
- **Limitations**
    
    - Simplified PHY model.
        
    - Single-hop focus.
        
- **Future work**
    
    - Multi-hop forwarding support.
        
    - Integration of real mobility traces.
        
    - Support for newer Wi-Fi standards and multi-link operation.
        
- **Final takeaway**
    
    - The simulator is a **general research tool**, while ProSafe is a **concrete, socially relevant application** that validates it.

% Utlizing the comments above try to write the chapter. And also explain the tecnical terms included. Maybe with online references usign LaTeX formatting and commands. you can use also the paper.pdf

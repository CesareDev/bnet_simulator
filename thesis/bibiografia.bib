  abstract = {This paper presents a new carrier sensing mechanism called DVCS (Directional Virtual Carrier Sensing) for wireless communication using directional antennas. DVCS does not require specific antenna configurations or external devices. Instead it only needs information on AOA (Angle of Arrival) and antenna gain for each signal from the underlying physical device, both of which are commonly used for the adaptation of antenna pattern. DVCS also supports interoperability of directional and omni-directional antennas. In this study, the performance of DVCS for mobile ad hoc networks is evaluated using simulation with a realistic directional antenna model and the full IP protocol stack. The experimental results showed that compared with omni-directional communication, DVCS improved network capacity by a factor of 3 to 4 for a 100 node ad hoc network.},
